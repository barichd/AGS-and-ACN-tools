### Fast and accurate estimation of the average genomes size and 16S rRNA average copy number in metagenomic data
Here, we present the ags.sh and acn.sh tools dedicated to the computation of the Average Genome Size (AGS) and 16S rRNA gene Average Copy Number (ACN), respectively. These metagenomic traits are computed based on the (ultra-fast) annotation of 35 universally distributed single-copy genes in unassembled metagenomic data.

### Installation
Before running ags.sh and acn.sh tools, it is necessary to install [docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Then just clone the GitHub repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:pereiramemo/AGS-and-ACN-tools.git
```

The ags.sh and acn.sh are distributed in two different docker images which will be downloaded automatically from [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/) the first time you run the run_ags.sh and run_acn.sh scripts.

### Go to the [wiki page](https://github.com/pereiramemo/AGS-and-ACN-tools/wiki) to find the documentation, more in detail installation instructions, and a getting started tutorial.
