### Fast and accurate estimation of the average genomes size and 16S rRNA average copy number in metagenomic data
###### In this work, we present the ags.sh and acn.sh tools dedicated to the computatoin of the Average Genome Size (AGS) and 16S rRNA gene Average Copy Number (ACN), respectively.
###### The computation of these traits is based on the annotation of 35 universaly distributed signle copy genes identified by Raes et al.,2012. 
###### The tools are publicly distributed under the GNU Licence v3 using Docker container technology.
