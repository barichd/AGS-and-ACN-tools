### Fast and accurate estimation of the average genomes size and 16S rRNA average copy number in metagenomic data
##### Here, we present the ags.sh and acn.sh tools dedicated to the computation of the Average Genome Size (AGS) and 16S rRNA gene Average Copy Number (ACN), respectively.  
The computation of these traits is based on the (ultra-fast) annotation of 35 universally distributed single-copy genes identified by Raes et al., 2007.
