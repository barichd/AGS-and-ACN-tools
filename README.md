### Fast and accurate estimation of the average genomes size and 16S rRNA average copy number in metagenomic data
##### Here, we present the ags.sh and acn.sh tools dedicated to the computation of the Average Genome Size (AGS) and 16S rRNA gene Average Copy Number (ACN), respectively.
##### The computation of these traits is based on the (ultra-fast) annotation of 35 universally distributed single-copy genes identified by Raes et al., 2007, which provide an accurate estimatiom of the total number of genomes (NGs) in a metagenome. 
#### To derive the AGS, the total number of base pairs is divided the NGs. Similarly, to derive the 16S rRNA gene ACN, the totanl number of base pairs annotated as 16S rRNA genes is diveded by the NGs. 
#### These tools are publicly distributed under the GNU Licence v3 using Docker container technology.
