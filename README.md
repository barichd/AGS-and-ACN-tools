### Fast and accurate estimation of the average genomes size and 16S rRNA average copy number in metagenomic data
##### In this work, we present two tools: ags.sh and acn.sh dedicated to the estimation of the Average Genome Size (AGS) and 16S rRNA gene Average Copy Number (ACN), respectively.  
##### These tools are distributed using Docker container technology.
